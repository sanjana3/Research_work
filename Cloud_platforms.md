1. Create a linux virtual machine using Azure portal

 Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. The Azure portal is a browser-based user interface to create Azure   resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. To see your VM in action, you also SSH to the VM and install the NGINX web server.
2. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
