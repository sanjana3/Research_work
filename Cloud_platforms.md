1. Create a linux virtual machine using Azure portal
 Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. The Azure portal is a browser-based user interface to create Azure   resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. To see your VM in action, you also SSH to the VM and install the NGINX web server.
2. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.


* Create a storage account on Azure portal - An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.
